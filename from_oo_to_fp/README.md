# From OO to FP (why?)

Practicing some FP using the following educational methodologies:

- Translate X into Y
- Do workflow Z

Covering the following topics:

- Functional Programming patterns
- TypeScript basics

## Method

1. Take a semi-realistic problem and build it in a dumb old school boring OO way.
2. Translate it into an FP implementation, compare and contrast.

## Specifics

1. In JavaScript like the good old days
2. In TypeScript like the new not scary days

## Principles

- Don't try to get round the type system! Embrace it.
- Don't randomly hit buttons in IntelliJ until the error goes away! Learn and fix em.
